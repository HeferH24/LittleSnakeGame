# LittleSnakeGame

this is a tiny game that i made, it does not use any graphical library, so im only using basic standard I/O
functions for "graphics"
this is suposed to be a cli game, currently i do not manage threads well enough to make it better (maybe you always 
use a library like ncurses, sdl2, etc).
As a consequence, it waits for each move. The algorithm that it uses for the snake is one that i made :), dont know if is used somewhere else or is just
a bad implementation-
