# LittleSnakeGame

This is a tiny game that I made, it does not use any graphical library, so im only using basic standard I/O functions for "graphics".
This is suposed to be a CLI game, currently I do not manage threads well enough to make it look better (maybe you always use a library like ncurses, sdl2, etc). 

As a consequence, it waits for each move (input character) using scanf :p. The algorithm that it uses for the snake is one that I made :), don't know if it is used
somewhere else or is just a bad implementation, anyway i would like to get feedback because I'm relatively new to C in general.
